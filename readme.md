* Credit goes to Adam Geitgey who is the author of this tutorial. I made some edits.

## Requirements

* Google Cloud Account
* Python installed
* Google SDK
* Pycharm
* Some knowledge of deep learning principles

## Objective
* This tutorial will help you build a simple deep learning neural network model using Tensorflow with Python to predict earnings.
* This tutorial shows you how to use the Google API kit to use Google's machine learning API to save a model to the cloud
* Once a model has been saved to the cloud you can call a model in any program using a credentials.json file to connect to the Google ML Api
